## BFS(breath first search)
BFS always use `queue` to achieve.

Goal: 
- traverse all elements
- find the shortest path

## DFS(depth first search)
It always use `stack` to achieve the function of traversal or search in tree and graph problem.

## Example
[200. Number of Islands](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/number-of-islands/) 

Both BFS and DFS [Cpp](https://github.com/Fieldwater/leetcode/blob/master/cpp/200_Number_of_Islands.cpp)
